## How could it be helpful in businesses? 🤔

1. It stores all the content that you may need after more than a year of writing down.
3. You have an Inventory/Suppliers/Customers and Deals dashboards that you can add,edit and delete items to/from it easily.
4. There is a searchbar that helps you finding the stored data.
5. Your data will be displayed in a well designed list.

### How does it work :question: 

We developed this website using React (Framework).
Our website is connected to Heroku (Could Database).
When registration we hash the passwords using (JWT) for users  security.

---

### Why React? 

React allowed us to
1. Reuse the components that we created and designed (e.g the registration input bars are the same Input component)
2. Using Hooks / States and pass them as props to child components and then accessing the data that has been modified inside child components in a parent component.
